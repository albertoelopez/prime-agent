# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

`AGENTS.md` in the repo root is the authoritative contribution guide (git rules for parallel agents, changelog format, provider-addition checklist, release process). Read it before committing. This file covers commands and architecture.

## Commands

```bash
npm run check        # biome (format+lint, --error-on-warnings) + tsgo --noEmit + installer/browser smoke checks
```

Run `npm run check` from the repo root after every code change and fix all errors, warnings, and infos. It does **not** run tests. It also runs as a pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`), which restages formatter-modified files.

Do not run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, or `npm test` unless the user asks. Run only focused tests, from the *package* root:

> This repo rule overrides any global "run the full test suite before claiming done" default. Here, `npm run check` is the standard post-change gate; the full suite is opt-in and the user asks for it. If you create or modify a test file you must still run *that file* and iterate until it passes.

```bash
cd packages/coding-agent
npx tsx ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/specific.test.ts
```

Package test entrypoints (what CI runs, all from the package dir):

| Package | Command | Runner |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/agent`, `packages/ai`, `packages/coding-agent` | `npm test` | vitest |
| `packages/tui` | `npm test` | `node --test --import tsx` |
| `packages/coding-agent` (CI shards) | `npm run test:ci -- --shard=1/3` | bootstraps the kernel, excludes the process suite |
| `packages/coding-agent` | `npm run test:process` / `npm run test:kernel` | isolated daemon-process and kernel-heavy suites |

`./test.sh` runs the whole suite with `auth.json` moved aside and every provider env var unset — that is the only sanctioned full-suite path, and it touches `~/.prime/agent/auth.json`.

### Running from source

```bash
./prime-agent.sh              # tsx against packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts; preserves the caller's cwd
./prime-agent.sh --dist       # the bundled build (~3x faster startup); requires npm run build first
./prime-agent.sh --no-env     # unset all provider API keys first
PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR=/tmp/pa-dev ./prime-agent.sh   # isolated config dir; use when exercising daemon behavior
```

Requires Node >= 22.8.0, plus `ripgrep`, `fd`, and `uv` (for the Python kernel venv) on PATH.

## Architecture

Four npm workspaces, layered bottom-up. Root `tsconfig.json` maps the package names to `src/`, so cross-package imports resolve to sources, not `dist/`.

- **`packages/tui`** — terminal UI primitives: differential renderer, editor component, keybindings, autocomplete. No agent knowledge.
- **`packages/ai`** — unified LLM API. `stream.ts` + `providers/*.ts` normalize every provider into one `AssistantMessageEventStream` (`text` / `tool_call` / `thinking` / `usage` / `stop`). Providers are lazily registered in `providers/register-builtins.ts`; credentials are detected in `env-api-keys.ts`. `providers/faux.ts` is the deterministic test provider.
- **`packages/agent`** — provider-agnostic agent loop (`agent-loop.ts`, `agent.ts`): tool execution, queueing, state, transport abstraction.
- **`packages/coding-agent`** — the Prime Agent product: CLI, daemon, session persistence, IPython kernel, TUI modes, skills, extensions, MCP.
- **`prime-agent-runtime/`** — the Python side (`rlm` package) copied into `dist/` at build time and installed into the managed kernel venv.

### Process topology (packages/coding-agent)

Execution never lives in the client. `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/daemon.md`, `docs/agent-connection.md`, and `docs/rlm-runtime.md` are the reference; the shape is:

```
client (interactive TUI / print / JSON / RPC)
  └─ AgentConnection            src/modes/agent-connection/   client-side execution boundary
      └─ daemon supervisor      src/modes/daemon/             sockets, routing, attachments, health, agent-message delivery
          ├─ catalog subprocess                               saved-session scans (failures don't touch live workers)
          └─ session worker     one root session tree per process
              └─ AgentSessionRuntime → AgentSession → IPython kernel + RLM child sessions
```

- `AgentSession` (`src/core/agent-session.ts`) owns provider calls, queues, tools, compaction, goals, child lifecycles, and transcript writes. It is the center of gravity of the codebase.
- `AgentConnection` is a TypeScript intent interface, **not** the wire protocol. `DaemonAgentConnection` is the normal local adapter; `InProcessAgentConnection` is the SDK/fallback path. Both must satisfy the same interface.
- Workers and kernels are separate processes for lifecycle and failure containment — **not** a security sandbox. Model-generated Python runs with the user's permissions.
- Sessions are leased by canonical JSONL path so two writers can never share a transcript.

### RLM (recursive subagents)

`await rlm("prompt", name=..., model=...)` in the model's IPython cell travels over a Jupyter comm target (`host.request`) → `KernelManager` (`src/core/kernel/index.ts`) → typed dispatch in `src/core/rlm-runtime.ts` → `AgentSession.runRlmChild()`. The call returns a spawn handle at *admission*; it never returns the child's answer — results come back as explicit `agent_message` replies or files. Host-request responses go on the Jupyter **control** channel; using shell would deadlock the awaiting cell.

State ownership: the TypeScript host owns models, credentials, depth limits, the child registry, and usage attribution. The Python `rlm` shim is a thin bridge with no agent loop. Bundled Python skills (`goal`, `agent_message`, harness) are likewise host-bridge clients.

### Local models

There is no built-in Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM provider and nothing auto-detects a local server. Local models are custom providers in `~/.prime/agent/models.json`, loaded by `ModelRegistry` (`src/core/model-registry.ts`) and pointed at the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "ollama",
      "models": [{ "id": "qwen2.5-coder:7b" }]
    }
  }
}
```

`id` is the only required model field — `ModelDefinitionSchema` defaults the rest specifically for local models. Any `api` the repo supports works (`openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, `anthropic-messages`, Google Generative AI); anything needing a custom API implementation or OAuth belongs in an extension (`docs/custom-provider.md`).

Two things to preserve when touching this path:

- **`compat` flags.** Many OpenAI-compatible servers reject the `developer` role and `reasoning_effort`; `compat.supportsDeveloperRole` / `compat.supportsReasoningEffort` (provider- or model-level) fall back to a `system` message and drop the effort param.
- **Overflow matchers.** `packages/ai/src/utils/overflow.ts` carries per-server context-overflow regexes (llama.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama). Adding a backend usually means adding a matcher. That file reports Ollama truncating silently in some setups, which was not reproduced here — do not restate it as established for this machine.

Test caveat: `packages/ai/test/stream.test.ts` and `test/context-overflow.test.ts` shell out to a real local `ollama` binary — including `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b` — when one is on PATH. Set `PI_NO_LOCAL_LLM=1` to skip those blocks (`./test.sh` already does).

#### Ollama setup notes

> **Check which Ollama is serving before following any of this.** The Homebrew service and the
> Ollama desktop app both bind `127.0.0.1:11434`, and whichever starts first wins. If the app is
> installed it takes the port, the Homebrew service fails with `bind: address already in use`, and
> every plist instruction below silently does nothing — the app ignores that plist and serves the
> 4096 default. Confirm with `lsof -nP -iTCP:11434 -sTCP:LISTEN` (look at the binary path) and
> `brew services list` (an `error` status means it lost the port).

Two non-obvious things decide whether a local model works here at all.

**The model must support tool calling.** Prime Agent drives everything through the IPython tool, so a completion-only or vision-only model cannot function as the agent no matter how it is configured. Check with `ollama show <model>` and look for `tools` under Capabilities before adding it to `models.json`.

**The declared `contextWindow` must match what the server actually serves.** Ollama's default is 4096 regardless of the model's maximum, and it truncates silently rather than returning an overflow error — so a config claiming 32768 against a 4096 server degrades output with no diagnostic. 4096 is too small for the system prompt alone. Verify the real number by loading a model and reading the `CONTEXT` column:

```bash
ollama ps
```

Raise the server side with `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`. Under a Homebrew launchd install, add it to the existing `EnvironmentVariables` dict and reload with `launchctl`, not `brew services restart`. Measured: that command regenerates the plist from the formula and drops `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, putting you back at 4096. It does *not* drop `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION` or `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE` — those are set by the formula's own `service` block, so regeneration restores them. Only genuinely custom variables are lost:

```bash
P=~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.ollama.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Add :EnvironmentVariables:OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH string 32768" "$P"
launchctl unload "$P" && launchctl load "$P"
```

`OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0` is a Homebrew formula default here, not something to add. It is widely reported to roughly halve KV-cache memory — not measured on this machine, so treat the factor as approximate. `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` is global to the server, so every model loads at that context.

End-to-end check once configured:

```bash
prime-agent model list ollama                                    # provider and models resolve
prime-agent --provider ollama --model <id> --no-session -p "hi"  # round-trip through the agent
```

#### MLX on Apple Silicon

`mlx_lm.server` exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and works as a provider with no special handling — same `openai-completions` api and same `compat` flags as Ollama. Tool calling is supported: it returns a well-formed `tool_calls` array with `finish_reason: tool_calls`, and the full agent loop drives IPython through it.

```json
"mlx": {
  "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1",
  "api": "openai-completions",
  "apiKey": "mlx",
  "compat": { "supportsDeveloperRole": false, "supportsReasoningEffort": false },
  "models": [{ "id": "mlx-community/Qwen3-14B-4bit", "contextWindow": 32768 }]
}
```

MLX applies no artificial context cap the way Ollama does — it serves the model's own `max_position_embeddings`, which is not advertised over `/v1/models` and has to be read from the model's `config.json` in the HuggingFace cache:

```bash
find ~/.cache/huggingface/hub -path "*<model>*/config.json" -exec \
  python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))['max_position_embeddings'])" {} \;
```

**Declare the lower of the model ceiling and what the machine can hold.** Qwen3-14B reports 40960, but on a 24 GB M4 that is more than the machine can serve: a 38,859-token prompt completes, while one in the 41k range exhausts GPU memory and kills the server (see below). 32768 is the value that actually works. The model's limit and the machine's limit are different numbers and the smaller one governs.

#### MLX context overflow has two regimes

Which one you hit depends on whether the oversized prompt fits in GPU memory, and only one of them is detectable. Measured against `mlx_lm.server` 0.31.3 serving `Qwen3-14B-4bit` on an M4 / 24 GB.

**Over the declared window but within memory — detected.** A 38,859-token prompt against a declared `contextWindow` of 32768 completes normally with `stopReason: "stop"` and an honest `usage.input` of 38,859. `isContextOverflow(message, 32768)` returns `true` through the existing silent-overflow path (`usage.input > contextWindow`), the same one z.ai uses. No new pattern is needed; the current code already handles this, and it is the case ordinary use runs into.

**Beyond what memory can hold — undetectable.** MLX never rejects or truncates. It prefills past `max_position_embeddings` until Metal reports insufficient memory and the process aborts mid-request:

```
Prompt processing progress: 40960/50013
libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error:
[METAL] Command buffer execution failed: Insufficient Memory
```

`packages/ai` surfaces that as `errorMessage: "Connection error."`, which `isContextOverflow` correctly returns `false` for — a dropped socket is equally consistent with a crash or a network fault, so matching it would misclassify every server failure. Do not add a transport-error pattern to `OVERFLOW_PATTERNS`.

Declaring a `contextWindow` the machine can actually hold keeps you in the first regime, where compaction runs on a detected overflow instead of the server dying. A `KeepAlive` launchd agent restarts it after such a crash, which makes the failure easy to miss.

`models.json` is read at session start, so a changed `contextWindow` needs a restart — `/context` in a running session keeps reporting the old figure until then.

On throughput, measured on an M4 / 24 GB with Qwen3-14B at 4 bits on both backends:

| Prompt | Metric | MLX | Ollama |
|---|---|---|---|
| 38 tok | generation | 11.4 tok/s | 10.5 tok/s |
| 18k tok | total wall time | 96.0 s | 111.1 s |

MLX is roughly 9–14% faster for the same weights. Benchmark with the *same* model on both sides or the result is meaningless — an earlier comparison of 14B-on-MLX against 9.7B-on-Ollama showed Ollama ahead on raw tok/s purely because it was carrying 44% fewer parameters. Note also that published 2x figures compare Ollama's own Metal and MLX backends, which is a different measurement again.

When timing a long prompt, compare total wall time, not `completion_tokens / elapsed` — at 18k tokens the request is dominated by prefill, so that ratio is not a generation rate and swings wildly between runs.

Ollama's built-in MLX backend (0.19 preview, 0.30 stable) is a separate thing from `mlx_lm.server` and requires more than 32 GB of unified memory, so it is unavailable on smaller machines regardless of Ollama version.

#### Model sizing on a 24 GB machine

Tested and rejected, so nobody re-downloads 31 GB to rediscover it:

| Model | Weights | Resident | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen3.6:27b` | 17 GB | — | never loaded; drove swap to 19.5 GB |
| `devstral:24b` | 14 GB | 18 GB | loaded 100% GPU but only 6.1 tok/s, 10% memory free |
| `Qwen3-14B-4bit` | 8 GB | ~10 GB | 11.4 tok/s, machine stays comfortable |

`sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb` reports what the GPU may claim, not what is free — macOS, the browser, and any other model server share the same unified memory. Sizing a model against that limit rather than against actual free memory is what put a 17 GB model into swap. Extrapolating from the three rows above, the practical ceiling for weights on a 24 GB machine is somewhere around 12–14 GB — the boundary is not measured, only bracketed by 14 GB working and 17 GB failing, so the 14B class is the safe tier and 24B upward is not.

Two smaller traps. Resident footprint runs well above download size once the KV cache is allocated — `devstral:24b` is a 14 GB download that occupies 18 GB at 32k context. And some models carry a large built-in chat template: the same 38-token prompt bills 1251 tokens against `devstral:24b`, overhead paid on every request.

#### Making a local model the default

`defaultProvider` and `defaultModel` in `~/.prime/agent/settings.json` are separate fields — `defaultModel` holds a bare model id, not a `provider/model` reference:

```json
"defaultProvider": "mlx",
"defaultModel": "mlx-community/Qwen3-14B-4bit"
```

A model id containing `/` is safe in settings, and also safe on the command line — verified: `--model mlx-community/Qwen3-14B-4bit` with no `--provider` resolves correctly. `resolveModel` only treats the prefix as a provider when it matches a *known* provider name, and otherwise falls through to an exact match on the full id. The hazard is narrower than it looks: a collision, where a model id begins with a real provider name (`openai/...`), which would be split rather than matched whole.

Verify which model actually served a request with JSON mode rather than trusting the reply:

```bash
prime-agent --mode json --no-session -p "hi"   # emits message.provider / message.model / message.api
```

This matters whenever cloud credentials are present. If the configured default fails to resolve, the run silently falls back to another provider and print mode looks identical, so a plausible answer is not evidence the intended model ran.

### Config and asset resolution

User config: `~/.prime/agent/` (sessions, session-artifacts, auth.json, kernel-venv, logs). Project config: `.prime/agent/`. Overrides: `PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `PRIME_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`.

Always resolve packaged assets through `src/config.ts` helpers (`getPackageDir`, `getThemeDir`) — the same code runs from source, from `dist/`, and from a bundled release artifact, so `__dirname` is wrong.

### Naming

"Prime Agent" is the product and repo; the workspaces keep inherited `@earendil-works/pi-*` names, a `pi` bin entry, a `pi` manifest key, and some `PI_*` env vars. `scripts/pack-prime-agent-release.mjs` rewrites those for the public release tarball. Never document the npm workspace package as the install path.

## Conventions that bite

- **No inline imports.** No `await import("./foo.js")`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions. Top-level imports only.
- **Never edit `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts`** — change `packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts` instead. It is fine to include the generated file in an otherwise unrelated commit.
- **Never hardcode key checks** (e.g. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`). Add a default to `DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS`; all bindings are configurable.
- **No empty `catch {}`** without an explanatory comment — `test/no-silent-catch.test.ts` scans every `packages/*/src` for it.
- **Daemon wire changes** (`src/modes/daemon/daemon-protocol.ts`): classify as backward-compatible, capability-gated, or incompatible. Bump `DAEMON_PROTOCOL_VERSION` for incompatible changes, update `DAEMON_SCHEMA_REVISION` and the command/event compatibility maps for every wire change, and update both new-client/old-daemon and old-client/new-daemon tests. New commands may never become part of startup without a protocol or capability gate.
- **Tests under `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/`** must use `test/suite/harness.ts` plus the faux provider — no real provider APIs, keys, or network. Issue regressions go in `test/suite/regressions/` named `<issue-number>-<short-slug>.test.ts`.
- **Changelogs** live per package (`packages/*/CHANGELOG.md`). New entries always go under `## [Unreleased]` as flat one-line bullets starting with a past-tense verb; released sections are immutable. All packages are versioned in lockstep.
- **Dependencies** carry a 7-day minimum release age (`.npmrc` `min-release-age=7`, enforced only by npm >= 11.10). Do not bypass it for routine updates.
